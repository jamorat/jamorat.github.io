# Open Source Mesh Networking

Imagine a little screen on your keychain that is the same diminutive size as a credit card. This is HiJump. It is no mere credit card. Whatever you type onto your HiJump appears on the HiJump of anyone within 50 feet of you. Oh, and by the way - your message can JUMP to other people within 50 feet of them. And so on. As a toy, it allows kids to keep in touch with one another even when mobile phones are not allowed. For grown ups, it keeps communication flowing when the shit hits the fan and the network is down. For tech explorers working on their doohickies and thingies, they can route their output into HiJump and have instant mesh networking. Hi Jump is a bad ass open source project.

This project was founded by Jack Amoratis and Patrick Woodburn. Jack had been thinking of the idea of a small connected display/keyboard since he lived in Alaska. In that area cellular internet signals were sporadic at best. Jack and Patrick have known each other for almost a year through Philadelphia open source events and it turned out they were both looking to work on a project together, but the right occasion never seemed to come about. Then on Thursday November 18 in 2014, as the Winter Solstice approached and Mars entered into the 7th House of Melgamem, Jack mentioned his idea about a mesh networked keyboard/screen that would be small enough to fit on a keychain, and Patrick became very interested and decided that he could make it real. Patrick is experienced and interested in mesh networking. His main IDE for coding is VIM. Shit got real. Within 30 minutes they had sketched out a prototype and ordered some parts. Work is now ongoing.
