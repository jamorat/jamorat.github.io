## Jack Amoratis & Patrick Woodburn

jack_and_pat.jpg

This project was founded by Jack Amoratis and Patrick Woodburn. Jack had been thinking of the idea of a small connected display/keyboard for years. Jack and Patrick have known each other for almost a year through Philadelphia open source events and it turned out they were both looking to work on a project together but thr right occasion never seemed to come about. On Thursday November 18 in 2014, Jack mentioned one idea to Patrick - a mesh networked portable internet device for times of national disasters. Patrick was not very keen on it. But when Jack mentioned his idea about the mesh networked keyboard/screen that would be small enough to fit on a keychain, Patrick became very interested. Patrick is experienced and interested in networking. Within 30 minutes they had sketched out a prototype and ordered some parts. Work is now ongoing.
